1. This module is configured with 7 Arduino display test codes and 6 SD card test codes.

2. This test code is applicable to uno, mega2560, etc. it can be directly inserted into corresponding positions for test without wiring.

3. Example01 simple test is the simplest test. It does not need to rely on the installation library. It can directly test the hardware quality of the module by swiping the screen in red, green and blue.

4. Both example02-07 need to depend on the library. Please copy the library in install libraries to the Arduino library path first.

5. The extension routines sdcard extend example and example05 showbmp need SD card. The test program involving SD card only supports uno series, not mega2560

6. The IDE version used in this test program is arduino-1.6.2-windows. If the user's version is lower than 1.62, there may be compilation errors. Please change to a new version.
